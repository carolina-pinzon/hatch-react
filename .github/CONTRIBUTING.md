# Contributing Guidelines

We welcome contributions from anyone interested in helping improve the project. You can help out by opening an issue for bugs you find or features you would like to see implemented, or by submitting a pull request addressing an existing issue.

## Getting started

- Create an issue for your proposed change (if one does not already exist)
- Clearly describe the proposed change
- List steps to reproduce if it is a bug

## Making changes

- Create a topic branch for the issue based from `staging`
  - Name the branch `<name>/#<issue number>-<description>`
- Make commits of logical units
- Add tests that cover your changes
  - For bug fixes, add a test that fails without fix
  - For features, add tests that cover all cases of your feature

## Submitting changes

- Push your changes to your topic branch
- Submit a pull request to the repository
